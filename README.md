Why doesn't the integer change after the method call?
* It dosen't change becasue the value is only being redefined within the method and no where else
Why does the array change after the method call?
* You are interacting directly changing it from the location where it's stored
What happens when you try to access y outside the loop?
* I returns an error becasue y technically does not exist outside the loop
